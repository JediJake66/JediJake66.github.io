          <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
          <p>
            My passion with computer systems started a very young age. As I
            started growing up so did technologies all around me. I had to
            understand it all. So I started taking computers apart and putting
            them back together. I've installed and worked with countless
            different types of software from music tools like ProTools to POS
            systems like Micros. I also enjoy reprogramming handheld game
            systems to unlock their full potential. More recently I have started
            my journey into software engineering and website development and
            have learned several new languages. Such as: Java, Javascript, HTML,
            CSS, and Spring. I also have experience in utilizing agile and scrum
            methodologies in a team environment.

            My passion for Star Wars bleeds over into my programming here where
            I wrote a web application using a MVC design pattern. The languages
            I used was Java, HTML, and CSS. I provided pictures of my own lego
            sets and wrote brief desciptions on some of my favorite ones.

            This is a team project where we made a wen application for children ages 6-13. The user has an opportunity to learn about classic art, be given a random activity to do, or select a link to a number of fun games. We utilized agile and scrum methodologies to complete the project before the deadline. We used a MVC design to create our own API and used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to wire in API's from the Metropolitan Art Museum and Bored.
