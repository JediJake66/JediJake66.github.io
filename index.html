                <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
                <p>My passion with computer systems started a very young age. Our families first PC, in fact, ran MS-DOS and I would spend hours cataloging my baseball cards. As I started growing up so did technologies all around me. I had to understand it all. So I started taking computers apart and putting them back together and by now I'm actually rather good at it. I've installed and worked with countless different types of software from music tools like ProTools to POS systems like Micros. More recently I have started my journey into software engineering and website development and I couldn't be happier! </p>
